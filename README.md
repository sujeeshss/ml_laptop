"""**Questions to Explore:**

Which features have the most significant impact on laptop prices?

*   RAM, SSD, Screen Resolution, CPU

Can the model accurately predict the prices of laptops from lesser-known brands?

*   The model cannot predict the price of lesse known brands due to comparitively less data of such brands

Does the brand of the laptop significantly influence its price?

*   Yes, price range varies on top brands

How well does the model perform on laptops with high-end specifications compared to budget laptops?

*   As the number of budget laptops are comparitively more in the dataset, the model gets more data for training and which directly impacts the prediction.

What are the limitations and challenges in predicting laptop prices accurately?

*   ML models typically focus on technical specifications. Brand reputation and popularity can influence price more than technical features and it is usuallyincomprehensible for ML models. Also dataset size play a vital role in prediction accuracy.

How does the model perform when predicting the prices of newly released laptops not present in the training dataset?

*   If new features are present in upcoming laptop models the ML model may produce less accurate results
